Warning: after running the glyphhanger command, don't forget to:
  - update the unicode-range of the subsetted font-family in the GaufrePage.astro component. The new unicode-range is outputed in the console when running glyphhanger.
  - rename the newly generated \`Marianne-Regular-subset.woff2\` file to add a cachebusting number, that is superior to the one in the previous filename already existing in the folder.
  - update the subsetted font-face src url in the GaufrePage.astro component to use the newly named filename.
  - delete the previously existing subsetted font file in the \`public/fonts\` directory.
  - commit and push the changes.`),
